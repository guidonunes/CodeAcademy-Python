# CodeAcademy Python - BI Data Analyst Projects

## Overview

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of the Codecademy Python course focused on building foundational skills for a Business Intelligence (BI) Data Analyst career. Throughout this course, you'll learn how to analyze data, build dashboards, and deliver impactful reports, ultimately preparing you for a job in BI.

While this course is currently unfinished, it already includes several portfolio-worthy projects that demonstrate core competencies in Python and data analysis.

## Course Goals

The CodeAcademy Python course is designed to help you:

* Learn the basics of Python programming for data analysis.
* Master data visualization techniques and dashboard creation.
* Deliver insightful reports that help businesses make data-driven decisions.
* Build a portfolio with practical projects to showcase your skills to potential employers.

## Projects in This Repository

## caesar_cipher
A custom method to encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar Cipher.
